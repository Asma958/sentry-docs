The Issue Details page helps you to gain further insight into the source of the issue. The information that is provided on the primary Issues page also displays on the Issue Details page. This page displays information about a specific error event that's part of an issue, however, you can navigate between the events of an issue using the "Older" and "Newer" buttons.

TO DO Add screenshot here of Issue Details page

Click on an issue on the main Issues page to open the Issue Details page.

This page displays the Details tab when it first opens, but several other tabs are available:

- Activity: A history of activity for the event where team members can share comments.
- User Feedback: Any feedback collected from users through the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/user-feedback/">SDK's user feedback</PlatformLink>. 
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments/">Attachments</PlatformLink>: Stored additional files, such as config or log files that are attached to the event. 
- Tags: More detailed information about the tags across all the events included in the issue.
- Events: A list of all the events included in the issue.
- Merged Issues: A list of issues that have been merged with this one.
- Similar Issues: A list of issues that have a similar stack trace.

In the right hand sidebar, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) reflects how often the issue has occurred in the last 24 hours and the last 30 days, as well as the last time and the first time the issue was seen. If the issue is linked to any GitHub or Jira issues, that's displayed here as well. You can also use this section to link to existing GitHub or Jira issues. Lastly, there is a facet map, which shows the distribution of values for the tags for all events included in the issue. All of these values are based on the environment that you've selected in the Global Header.

In addition, this page provides several other key pieces of information.

## Suspect Commits

If you've configured [suspect commits](/product/releases/suspect-commits/), these are displayed. This allows you to immediately investigate commits that are likely to have generated the issue. The owners of suspect commits can be suggested assignees for an issue as well.

## Tags

Tags are the diagnostic information set by the SDK for the individual event. These are specific to each event in an issue. You can set your own tags to make them more useful for debugging as described in <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">Customize Tags</PlatformLink>.

## Stack Trace

The Exception section of the page displays the stack trace, which shows you the line of code that all of the events in the issue errored on. It's the most important piece of information that the Sentry grouping algorithm uses to group events into one issue.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs provide a history and timeline leading up to error event. These can include things like HTTP requests, log statements from the console or server, and DOM (document object model) events in JavaScript. You can set your own <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">breadcrumbs</PlatformLink> to make them more useful for debugging.


## Trace Details

The Headers section of the page displays metadata about the host that produced the issue, including user, browser, operating system, SDK and version, and trace details. [Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/) augments your existing error data by capturing interactions between your software systems. You can click the "Search by Trace" button to see all the events that share the same trace ID.

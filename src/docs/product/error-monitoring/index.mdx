The Issues page of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) is where you can view, [triage](/product/error-monitoring/issue-details/), and resolve error events sent by your application. A typical application sends a large number of events to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). To make them manageable, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) groups similar events into issues based on the event stack trace and other information. You can think of an issue as a single bug or problem with your app. This grouping of events into issues allows you to see how frequently a problem is happening and how many users it's affecting. With this information, you can then make decisions about what to do.

The Issues page is organized into tabs, each corresponding to a filtered list of issues:

- All Unresolved (`is:unresolved`): All unresolved issues, including issues in the "For Review" tab
- For Review (`is:unresolved is:for_review`): Issues that need to be reviewed
- Ignored (`is:ignored`): All ignored issues
- Saved Searches: Select from a set of [premade](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/search/#premade-searches) and custom [saved searches](/product/sentry-basics/search/#organization-wide-saved-searches). The name of the tab changes based on your selection.

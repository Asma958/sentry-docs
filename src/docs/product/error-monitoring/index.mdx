The Issues page is where you can find information about important groups of errors in your application. Filter by error event properties such as browser, device, impacted users, or whether the error is unhandled. You can then inspect issue details to better understand the problem and [triage](/product/error-monitoring/issue-details/) effectively.

## Error Events and Issues

A typical application sends a large number of events to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). To make them manageable, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) groups similar events into issues based on the event stack trace and other information. You can think of an issue as a single bug or problem with your app. This grouping of events into issues allows you to see how frequently a problem is happening and how many users it's affecting. With this information, you can then make decisions about what to do.

From the Issues page, you can begin to triage an issue. Learn more about triaging issues and their different states in [Issue States and Triage](/product/error-monitoring/states-triage/).

For each issue, the page displays:

- Error type and message
- Brief description of the issue
- Associated project
- Issue timing, such as last and first time seen

## Issues Page Tabs

The Issues page is organized into tabs, each corresponding to a filtered list of issues:

- All Unresolved (`is:unresolved`): All unresolved issues, including issues in the "For Review" tab
- For Review (`is:unresolved is:for_review`): Issues that need to be reviewed
- Ignored (`is:ignored`): All ignored issues
- Saved Searches: Select from a set of [premade](/product/sentry-basics/search/#premade-searches) and custom [saved searches](/product/sentry-basics/search/#organization-wide-saved-searches). The name of the tab changes based on your selection.

These different lists also help you with the triaging process.

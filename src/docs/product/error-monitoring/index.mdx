The Issues page is where you can find information about important groups of errors in your application. Filter by error event properties such as browser, device, impacted users, or whether the error is unhandled. You can then inspect issue details to better understand the problem and [triage](/product/error-monitoring/issue-details/) effectively.

The Issues page is organized into tabs, each corresponding to a filtered list of issues:

- All Unresolved (`is:unresolved`): All unresolved issues, including issues in the "For Review" tab
- For Review (`is:unresolved is:for_review`): Issues that need to be reviewed
- Ignored (`is:ignored`): All ignored issues
- Saved Searches: Select from a set of [premade](/product/sentry-basics/search/#premade-searches) and custom [saved searches](/product/sentry-basics/search/#organization-wide-saved-searches). The name of the tab changes based on your selection.
